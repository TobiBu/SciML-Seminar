# SciML-Seminar
Repository of requirements and additional material for the notebooks from Christian Kleiber's seminar talk about variational autoencoders (VAE) in January 2024.
The original repo can be found here: 

### interpolate.py
Helper function for interpolation of two or more datapoints. 

### LatentspaceExplorer.py
Helper for a interface to explore the effect of each individual latent space dimension in the cartoon example. 

### requirements.txt
Includes all the requited packages to run the code. Indluces also some redundant packages like Tensorflow, which are not needed, but still are in the venv somehow.

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements (for Windows 10).

### models
Folder where all the pretrained models and their respective loss histories are saved.

### gifs
Folder for saving interpolation gifs.
